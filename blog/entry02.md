## Context
My topic is Ultrasound Technology. This topic is really vague with it's equiptment, but has many difficult parts to learn. During researching about the machinaries, I've learned alot from websites such as [this one](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ultrasound-transducer?lang=us) This website contains information about the hardware of Ultrasound Technology which are the tranducers. I've learned that there are many components to this hand-held part of the Ultrasound machine, such as the arrangements of piezoelectric crystals which allows them to generate electric voltage when force is applied. I found tools such as this one from googling the hardware and researching more about the things I didn't know of. 

## EDP
I am on step 2 of the engineering design process. I researched problems related to Ultrasound Technology and I found that there were some problems with the limitations of what we can observe based on the sound waves. Since ultrasounds are done based off tranducers, sound waves cannot travel through bone or air, which limits what we can see especially on somewhere such as the lungs or bones. I found this issue after searching 'what are some problems with ultrasound technology'. It showed me to [this website](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound#pid-931) This website also states a solution, which is that nowadays, researchers at Duke University have developed a method to be able to see through thick and multi-layered tissue, that can help with observing bones and repairing more. Some plans I have for brainstorming are to research on more problems and solutions that may or may not already be present today already.
