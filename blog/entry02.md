## Context
My topic is Ultrasound Technology. This topic is really vague with it's equiptment, but has many difficult parts to learn. During researching about the machinaries, I've learned alot from websites such as [this one](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ultrasound-transducer?lang=us) This website contains information about the hardware of Ultrasound Technology which are the tranducers. I've learned that there are many components to this hand-held part of the Ultrasound machine, such as the arrangements of piezoelectric crystals which allows them to generate electric voltage when force is applied. I found tools such as this one from googling the hardware and researching more about the things I didn't know of.
