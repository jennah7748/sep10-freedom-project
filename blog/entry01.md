## Context

I am a Sophomore at HSTAT currently taking the Software Engineering Program. This year, we are starting to do something called Freedom Projects. Freedom Projects can include finding a topic that the student wants to work with and researching about the topic with technology. 
## Content 

The topic I chose is medical ultrasonography. The reason I chose this topic is because this topic is in the field of where I'd want to work in the future. Along with this, ultrasonography also intrests me. Getting to learn about human anatomy while helping out a patient check out an area of need facinates me. In my personal experience, I've had an ultrasound done a while before for a surgery. During those 30 mintues, I kept wondering what the nurse was doing, how they were doing it, what they were seeing and more. This sparked an interest in me where I wanted to help do what the nurse was doing as well.  

My backup options would have been fashion or business because I'd also like to design some type of clothing.
## Sources 

This is the website that talks about [medical ultrasonography](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound)
This website explains how ultrasounds work and types of categories there are in ultrasound. 

These are the websites that talks about my other topics which are, [fashion](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/fashion-designers.htm) and [business](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business.asp)
This website explains the fashion field in depth such as the pay, enviornment, training time, etc.. 
The second website explains the business field in how to start a business, what a business is, what you do in a business & more. 
## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

Currently, I am on steps 1 and 2 of the engineering design process. Step 1 is to define the problem which in my case is Operator Dependency in where if there were ever a technical difficulty, it would be up to the sonographer to decide the results. Step 2 is to reasearch about the problem, where I found that this may be reduced through technological advancements to the devices themsleves. 
## Summary

The skills that I have learned in this blog entry were learning to google and be patient. I say this because I think up until the content everything was pretty simple as I just had to write based off what I thought, until the sources. For sources, I'd have to google to find websites that suited my topics. During these times, some websites I clicked onto had nothing to do with my topic I was searching for, so I had to learn to be patient and go through different websites to see which one suited most and made the most sense.
