## Context
I am a Sophomore at HSTAT currently taking the Softwear Engineering Program. This year, we are starting to do something called Freedom Projects. Freedom Projects can include finding a topic that the student wants to work with and researching about the topic with technology. 
## Content 
The topic I chose is medical ultrasonography. The reason I chose this topic is because this topic is in the field of where I'd want to work in the future. Along with this, ultrasonography also intrests me. Getting to learn about human anatomy while helping out a patient check out an area of need facinates me. In my personal experience, I've had an ultrasound done a while before for a surgery. During those 30 mintues, I kept wondering what the nurse was doing, how they were doing it, what they were seeing and more. This sparked an interest in me where I wanted to help do what the nurse was doing as well.
